# ðŸš€ Critical Traceable Calculator Project

This repository demonstrates **end-to-end traceability enforcement**. The design ensures that **only specified functionality** is implemented, and that **every requirement is tested** and **verified via CI**.

## âœ… Traceability Workflow

1. **Define Specification** â†’ `SPECIFICATION.md`
2. **Define Requirements** â†’ `docs/requirements.md` (with REQ-IDs)
3. **Implement Functions** â†’ `src/calculator.py` (each function tied to REQ-ID)
4. **Test Functions** â†’ `tests/` (each test tied to REQ-ID)
5. **Traceability Matrix** â†’ Auto-generated via `GENERATE_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.py`
6. **CI Enforcement** â†’ Rejects any commit or PR that violates traceability rules

## ðŸ§ª CI Enforced Rules

- All requirements must be implemented and tested
- No implementation or test without a declared requirement
- Commit messages must reference at least one REQ-ID
- All functions and test cases must be annotated with REQ-ID
- Traceability matrix must be valid and complete

## ðŸ’» Usage

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest --cov=src
```
