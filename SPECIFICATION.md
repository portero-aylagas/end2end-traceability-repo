# ðŸ“˜ System Specification â€” Structured (IEEE 830 Style)

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
Define functional and infrastructure behavior for a CI-enforced, traceable development system.

### 1.2 Scope
This specification applies to the development environment that enforces requirement-driven development, ensuring full traceability from specification to test.

## 2. Functional Specifications

| Spec ID    | Description                                           |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| SPEC-001   | The system shall support basic arithmetic operations. |
| SPEC-002   | The system shall validate inputs before computation.  |

## 3. Infrastructure Specifications

| Spec ID        | Description                                                                  |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SPEC-INF-001   | CI shall enforce traceability across all code, tests, and commit metadata.  |
| SPEC-INF-002   | CI shall enforce REQ-IDs exist in `requirements.md`.                        |
| SPEC-INF-003   | CI shall enforce REQ-coverage for implementation and testing.               |
| SPEC-INF-004   | CI shall reject commits/PRs without REQ-IDs.                                |
| SPEC-INF-005   | GitHub shall enforce status checks and PR review before merging.            |
| SPEC-INF-006   | GitHub shall prevent direct pushes to `main`.                               |
| SPEC-INF-007   | CI shall post traceability and test summary reports to the GitHub UI.       |
| SPEC-INF-008   | CI shall generate detailed coverage and requirement validation artifacts.   |
| SPEC-INF-009   | Commit messages and PR titles shall follow the REQ-ID enforcement pattern.  |
| SPEC-INF-010   | All traceability-relevant scripts must include logging for transparency.    |
| SPEC-INF-011  | CI shall allow unimplemented REQs but block implemented REQs without tests.  |
| SPEC-INF-012   | The traceability matrix must be generated dynamically in CI only.          |
| SPEC-INF-013   | The repo shall not store static traceability artifacts as tracked files.   |
